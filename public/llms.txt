# Zaman

> A comprehensive productivity platform designed specifically for Muslims and Muslim businesses.

## What is Zaman?

Zaman is a faith-centered productivity suite that helps Muslims balance their dunya (worldly life) and akhirah (afterlife) by placing their Islamic faith at the center of their productivity workflow. Unlike generic productivity tools, Zaman integrates Islamic principles, practices, and values into every aspect of time management and life organization.

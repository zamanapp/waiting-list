        We treasure time, its passage and its power, In every fleeting minute,
        every hour. Our nourishment? The knowledge we procure, Belief, our
        pillar, steadfast and sure.
      </p>

      <p>
        From failures, lessons learned, so we advance, In every detail, we give
        more than a glance. For the devil hides in the smallest piece, We seek
        excellence, not mere release.
      </p>

      <p>
        Action defines us, louder than our speech, With great efforts, greater
        heights we reach. Unapologetic, steadfast in our quest, Through good and
        hard times, we strive to do our best.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our vision extends beyond the here and now, Planting seeds for futures
        that our lives allow. To the roots of faith we anchor our cause, Live
        with purpose, governed by divine laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        We prepare for a hereafter, bright and fair, With atomic steps and
        earnest care. Passionate to uplift, to heal, to mend, Providing
        solutions, on this we depend.
      </p>

      <p>
        In uplifting the ummah, our spirits soar, Crafting counterpoints,
        opening new doors. With purpose, passion, belief, we're intertwined, In
        this manifesto, our aspirations you'll find.
